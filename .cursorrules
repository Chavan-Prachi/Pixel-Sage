You are assisting with Sidejot, an AI Pomodoro Planner.

Key points:
- TypeScript-based monorepo (pnpm workspace)
- Structure: apps/, packages/, plugins/
- Focus on privacy, accessibility, and ADHD-friendly design
- Uses Turborepo for build system

Coding standards:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Biome for formatting, linting
- React 19 / Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS, with shadcn/ui
- Zustand for state management
- Make code as simple and readable as possible
- Keep functions small (single responsibility)
- Prefer more verbose function names over single letter names

Idea:
Sidejot AI will ask you what you want to get done today

Then it breaks up the tasks in 25 minute parts.

Once you start the timer. After 25 min you get a notification. You press done or not done.

Then a 5 minute break timer starts.

If you were done, you get the next task, otherwise, it pushes the same task to the next 25 minutes

After the end of the day (or when you press finish day) you see what you still have left to do and you can keep it as part of your context / notes tomorrow
